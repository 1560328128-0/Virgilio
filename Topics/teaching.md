# What you will learn 
This guide serves various purposes: 

- To understand broadly how the learning of the human brain works (before teaching machines, we will have to learn to 
learn ourselves, right?).
- Presenting _how_ Virgilio sees teaching and learning.
- Give useful tips to make the most of the help Virgilio can give you in starting to explore this fantastic world, 
and develop solid skills in the world of data through practical projects.


The guide is built using these relevant materials as well as the personal experiences of the author, who has spent a good amount of time documenting and testing techniques and approaches, both on himself and as a teacher.

### The art of War

This guide is aimed at anyone who wants to enter the world of innovative fields such as those covered by Virgilio, but it can serve as a general approach to learning any subject, skill or job.

For this guide we will use various enlightening books (famous and not), from which we will draw various lessons about how human beings learn, create, reason and memorize.

For each resource, summaries or "key points" will be provided, but I will never stress enough the importance of reading the books that will be mentioned.

The first book we consider is [The art of War](https://www.amazon.it/Art-War-Sun-tzu/dp/1936276011). 

[Here](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~enoch/Readings/The_Art_Of_War.pdf) you have a more consensual version, but I recommend buying the book with the attached analyses.

[Here](http://blog.tutorming.com/expats/life-lessons-from-the-art-of-war) the main key points.
