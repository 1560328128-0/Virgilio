# How to Use Virgilio

# What you will learn 
This guide serves various purposes: 

- To understand broadly how the learning of the human brain works (before teaching machines, we will have to learn to 
learn ourselves, right?).
- Presenting _how_ Virgilio sees teaching and learning.
- Give useful tips to make the most of the help Virgilio can give you in starting to explore this fantastic world, 
and develop solid skills in the world of data through practical projects.


The guide is built using these relevant materials as well as the personal experiences of the author, who has spent a good amount of time documenting and testing techniques and approaches, both on himself and as a teacher.

## Prerequisites
It is recommended to read all the Paradise guides prior to this one.

## Time to complete
30 minutes.

### The art of War

This guide is aimed at anyone who wants to enter the world of innovative fields such as those covered by Virgilio, but it can serve as a general approach to learning any subject, skill or job.

For this guide we will use various enlightening books (famous and not), from which we will draw various lessons about how human beings learn, create, reason and memorize.

For each resource, summaries or "key points" will be provided, but I will never stress enough the importance of reading the books that will be mentioned.

The first book we consider is [The art of War](https://www.amazon.it/Art-War-Sun-tzu/dp/1936276011). 

[Here](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~enoch/Readings/The_Art_Of_War.pdf) you have a more consensual version, but I recommend buying the book with the attached analyses.

[Here](http://blog.tutorming.com/expats/life-lessons-from-the-art-of-war) the main key points.

The book is a condensed of the wisdom of various generals and heads of state of the ancient Chinese empire, and is used in many training courses, especially in management and decision making.
I firmly believe that its principles can apply to any human activity, particularly the planning of one's own self-improvement and learning. 
Today you don't learn a trade that you will do all your life, but you will have to re-invent yourself and learn new skills continuously. [**Who stops is lost!**](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for)

The two main points of instruction that I would like to emphasise are:
- Know your enemy
>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

This means that whenever you are faced with a problem, be it an enemy soldier, an engineering problem, or a human relationship, the best tactic is to know your enemy as much as possible. 

Continuing the analogy, knowing the enemy means knowing the number of his forces, how his army is composed, which are the most important departments.

In our case, it means knowing how much work awaits us, what is the perimeter of the things we want to learn, and what are the techniques most used in practice. 

If you try to do everything, you do nothing! Which brings us to the next point:

- Face one enemy at a time

How many tutorials have you seen of the type "learn Data Science" in 3 weeks, full of many topics and concepts, techniques and frameworks? This approach is totally unsuccessful (as well as disrespectful for those who take years and years of study), the reason is trivial. 
What we at Virgilio prefer to do is to outline a path that enables you to **take one step at a time**, learn one concept and apply it, preferring _a solid skill_ (developed in the right time) rather than knowing a thousand acronyms or exotic techniques.

This principle is another way of formulating the classic [**Divide et Impera**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide_and_rule_and_rule), a principle of software engineering whose purpose is to try to manage the growing complexity of programs, as well as generally advise to disassemble a problem into smaller pieces and address them separately. 
In a later section we will see how the principles of software engineering, dealing with complexity and logic, can be applied profitably to everyday life, rational thinking, and in general to the planning of our lives (professional and non-professional).
