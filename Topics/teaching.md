# How to Use Virgilio

# What you will learn 
This guide serves various purposes: 

- To understand broadly how the learning of the human brain works (before teaching machines, we will have to learn to 
learn ourselves, right?).
- Presenting _how_ Virgilio sees teaching and learning.
- Give useful tips to make the most of the help Virgilio can give you in starting to explore this fantastic world, 
and develop solid skills in the world of data through practical projects.


The guide is built using these relevant materials as well as the personal experiences of the author, who has spent a good amount of time documenting and testing techniques and approaches, both on himself and as a teacher.

## Prerequisites
It is recommended to read all the Paradise guides prior to this one.

### The art of War

This guide is aimed at anyone who wants to enter the world of innovative fields such as those covered by Virgilio, but it can serve as a general approach to learning any subject, skill or job.

For this guide we will use various enlightening books (famous and not), from which we will draw various lessons about how human beings learn, create, reason and memorize.

For each resource, summaries or "key points" will be provided, but I will never stress enough the importance of reading the books that will be mentioned.

The first book we consider is [The art of War](https://www.amazon.it/Art-War-Sun-tzu/dp/1936276011). 

[Here](https://sites.ualberta.ca/~enoch/Readings/The_Art_Of_War.pdf) you have a more consensual version, but I recommend buying the book with the attached analyses.

[Here](http://blog.tutorming.com/expats/life-lessons-from-the-art-of-war) the main key points.

The book is a condensed of the wisdom of various generals and heads of state of the ancient Chinese empire, and is used in many training courses, especially in management and decision making. I firmly believe that its principles can apply to any human activity, particularly the planning of one's own self-improvement and learning. 
Today you don't learn a trade that you will do all your life, but you will have to re-invent yourself and learn new skills continuously. [**Who stops is lost!**](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/ai-automation-and-the-future-of-work-ten-things-to-solve-for).

The two main points of instruction that I would like to emphasise are:
- Know your enemy
>“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

This means that whenever you are faced with a problem, be it an enemy soldier, an engineering problem, or a human relationship, the best tactic is to know your enemy as much as possible. 

Continuing the analogy, 

- Face one enemy at a time
