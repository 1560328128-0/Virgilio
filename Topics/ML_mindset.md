# The Data Science Project lifecycle

# What you will learn 
In this guide you will understand the big picture of the Data Science project lifecycle, why and how to perform each step, from getting the data to putting predictive models in production. You can then use this guide as a "checklist" of to-do steps to perform during your projects. 

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites for this guide.

## Time to complete
