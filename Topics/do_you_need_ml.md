# What you will learn 
The purpose of this guide is to warn you that there is not always a need for machine learning solutions. Don't mistake everything for a nail, just because you know how to use a hammer!

## Prerequisites
it would be appropriate to have read before:
- [Demystification about AI and ML](Demystification.md)
- [What do you need for ML](do_you_need_ml.md)

### Distinguish Hype from Opportunities
Although AI and Machine Learning offer immense business and product opportunities, they are not always the recipe for all evils. Indeed, be wary of those who tell you that with these tools you can solve any kind of problem. In this guide we try to break down the various factors that may suggest the non-feasibility of a Machine Learning project.

#### Not today, Hype

[Hype](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype) is a clamor around a person or a fact, an insistent and powerful voice that projects it to the top of the headlines and in positive opinions. Often (not always) however, it's a straw fire, a passing fashion that falls as the facts belie expectations.

There's too much hype around ML and in particular [Deep Learning](https://medium.com/@hypergiant/is-neural-network-hype-killing-machine-learning-120041406f1).  

Deep learning creates learning models by acquiring notions that are passed on to it by algorithms and that it organizes in a pyramidal way, managing to learn more complex concepts starting from the simplest ones.

But deep learning requires three elements to function, as we have seen in previous guides:

- date
- know-how
- computational power

Be wary of anyone who proposes a Deep Learning project that lacks one of these three elements, and ask specific questions about each of them. 
You can refer to [this previous guide](do_you_need_ml.md) for guidelines on how to compare responses and understand the feasibility of projects.
Of course, to fully evaluate the feasibility of a project you need experience and knowledge of the domain, but you can rest assured that if one of the three elements is missing, it is likely that what is being proposed is pure distillate of hype.

So we understand how justified hype is, in the sense that Deep Learning opens up incredible possibilities and without previous examples, but it is also a double-edged weapon, which can damage the very economy of technology because it does not meet the (too high) expectations.
