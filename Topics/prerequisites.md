# What do you need to do Machine Learning?

# Introduction 
The application of Machine Learning techniques is critical in analysing the data available to (public) organisations and extracting value from them. In order to do that, you need some critical elements.

# What you will learn 
In this guide you will learn which elements do you need to get started with Machine Learning.

The elements listed in this guide are of 3 types: 

 - know-how
 - data
 - computational resources.

**For each element** you'll learn:
- what you need to practice machine learning first-hand (small scale)
- what do you need to start machine learning projects to innovate an organization (big scale)


## Prerequisites
Read [Demystification of AI, ML and DS](Demystification.md) before this guide.

## Time to complete
Approximately 45 minutes. Less than a Netflix episode!

### The three elements
Virtually every area of science and economics has access to a quantity of data unimaginable even a decade ago. 
In addition to this, today there is abundant and inexpensive computing capacity available through cloud service providers. 
It is also important that international research is excited about machine learning topics, and therefore proceeds expeditiously in the development of increasingly effective techniques.
Parallel to this, the engineering world creates tools by adjusting itself accordingly: Tools to apply ML techniques quickly, more and more user-friendly. Keras, a high-level framework that allows you to train a deep neural network in 15 lines of code, is an example of this phenomenon.

The topics listed above have the following natural consequence:
Today more than ever (and an enormity compared to 5 years ago) it is immediate and affordable for everyone to start practicing ML in everyday problems, and it is an obligation in the shoes of a company that wants to remain competitive in a market that runs at crazy speed. 

Not all problems can be addressed with ML techniques and another guide will propose a conceptual framework to understand if the ML approach makes sense or not.
