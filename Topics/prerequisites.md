# What do you need to do Machine Learning?

# Introduction 

# Why 

# What you will learn 
In this guide you will learn which elements do you need to get started with Machine Learning.

The elements listed in this guide are of 3 types: 
 - know-how
 - data
 - computational resources.

**For each element** you'll learn:
- what you need to practice machine learning first-hand (small scale)
- what do you need to start machine learning projects to innovate an organization (big scale)


## Prerequisites
Read [Demystification of AI, ML and DS](Demystification.md) before this guide.

## Time to complete
Approximately 45 minutes. Less than a Netflix episode!
