Let's dive right in!
 
### Section A
Section A is great because it is the first section of them all!

And this would be another very interesting paragrah!
 
#### Subsection A1
In particular, I just went deeper into subsection A1!

#### Subsection A2
And of course there is subsection A2...

### Section B
Which is then followed by Section B.

### Practice 
Here you can give exercises to to in order to access to the nxt step of the path,
or a project from Kaggle. For the project, give some guidelines and try to give an example solution (you can easily find dozens of solution notebooks on Kaggle)

### Conclusions
We concluded that _x_, _y_ and _z_.

### Further reading
You should definitely check this if you liked **x**, or read this if you liked **y**.
