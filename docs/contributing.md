> ‚ÄúThere is immense power when a group of people with similar interests gets together to work toward the same goals.‚Äù 

The mission of Virgilio is to share free and curated knowledge paths and high-quality content, and we think that everyone can put his hands in this wonderful and serious game!

If you know how to use a tool or a framework, or you faced some business problems and their complications, why not writing a guide about it?
 
Several studies and empirical proofs show that to teach something is the fastest and most effective way to learn it.
Moreover, thousands of people will read it and would be grateful to you! üëç 
Don't worry about the correctness of your English or the deepness of your knowledge, experienced people at Virgilio will help you to make your guide of the highest quality.
If you want to contribute to the Virgilio project, join us on Slack and check-out or future guides roadmap, maybe you can find that we already need your help!
Feel free to suggest new ideas, guides, or entire sections! 


## Easiest way to contribute
The easiest way to contribute would be by sharing this repository with everyone you know. Send it to everyone who might enjoy leaning something new!

## Contributing with new guides
If you want to write a new guide, that would be great! You can contact us if you want to be sure that no one else is already writing about what you had in mind, or to find out if someone else would be interested in helping you write about a particular topic!

If you want to write a guide, please take some time to read a couple of them to get a feel for the style that the guides should follow. You can have a look at the WolframAlpha or GeoGebra guides.

Before writing, you also need to check the [Guide Template](#Guide-Template).

Do your best to write clearly and without errors! Provide relevant links whenever you can and only free resources. You are welcome to leave your contact details in the end of the guide, but you are not forced to do so!

# General Tips
In general Virgilio has to be the place that you go there and you can be sure that the next step you're tackling and the approach you do it are the right ones. This means that the ideal guide:
- Introduces you to the what, why and the context in plain English.
- Tells you which is the ‚Äúattack plan‚Äù, listing the contents and explaining why they are tackled in that way.
- Exposes you to practical experience with exercises and hands-on projects. Kaggle is a good place to find them: choose a project and give it as a ‚Äúfinal homework‚Äù, giving tips and different solutions (if possible).
- Drives you step-by-step through progressive theory+practice+example for each step. Like a book basically, but concise, with pointers to the right resources and brief suggestions about how to approach them.
- Gives you, for each step, some pointers to resources like "best practices for ____" or repos of examples.

You have a lot of examples that are the guides that have already been written.
As you can observe in our content, a Virgilio‚Äôs founding principle is: 
If you need to put inside some explanation, resource, or image that has already been done by someone else, don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel! 
Other authors will be more than happy to have credits and share of their work!
So, starting from these minimum requirements, the author can have total choice on "how much customize and augment the material" with his own production.
So each guide is a combination of pointers to resources, visualizations, videos and original Virgilio material.
In brief, the goal of each guide is to craft a end-to-end mentor/recipe list, that can bring you from zero to, at least, complete awareness and enough practice to start using the ____ and have clear which are the ‚Äúnext steps‚Äù.

   - [Subsection A2](#subsection-a2)
 - [Section B](#section-b)

Let's dive right in!
 
### Section A
Section A is great because it is the first section of them all!

And this would be another very interesting paragrah!
 
#### Subsection A1
In particular, I just went deeper into subsection A1!

#### Subsection A2
And of course there is subsection A2...

### Section B
Which is then followed by Section B.

### Conclusions
We concluded that _x_, _y_ and _z_.

### Further reading
You should definitely check this if you liked **x**, or read this if you liked **y**.

## Creating a Pull Request
If you are going to create a Pull Request, regardless of the reason, please take the time to give the PR a concise, relevant title (less than 50 characters) and write a descriptive, informative summary in the larger text field. This will let us review your PR faster, instead of having to first interpret what you did, and then decide if the changes are any good (which they probably are!).

We are very interested in having people help us! That is the point of a community! But we would rather not spend hours trying to decipher the changes you made.
